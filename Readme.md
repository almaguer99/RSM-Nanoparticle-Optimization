# DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

#### This dataset was used for optimizing the size and PDI properties of a Solid Lipíd Nanoparticle process using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) Analysis as stated on:

Alfaro-Almaguer, J. A., Chávez-Santoscoy, R. A., Sierra-Valdez, J. F., &
Ortíz, E. F. (2025). Design, synthesis and physicochemical evaluation of
Solid Lipid Nanoparticles for the improved transport of polyphenols
across a lipid membrane model. *Nano-Micro Letters*.

The raw data is inside a .csv file named `Data.csv` which contains four
rows:

-   For factors: `Lipid` and `Surfactant` which states for the amounts
    in `mg` of both components used in the Solid Lipid Nanoparticle
    synthesis process

-   For responses: `Size` and `PDI` which indicates the average diameter
    in `nm` of the nanoparticles, and the Polidispersity Index of the
    solution, respectively
